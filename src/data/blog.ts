    excerpt: "Discover how understanding your body shape can transform your style and confidence. Tips for every body type.",
    content: `Every man's body is unique, and dressing well starts with understanding your proportions. Here's your complete guide to looking your best, regardless of your body type.

## The Athletic Build
If you have broad shoulders and a narrow waist, you're working with an athletic frame. Fitted shirts and tailored blazers will highlight your proportions. Avoid overly baggy clothing that hides your shape.

## The Rectangular Build
Men with a rectangular build have similar shoulder and waist measurements. The key is to create the illusion of a V-shape. Structured blazers with padded shoulders and slim-fit trousers work wonders.

## The Round Build
For men carrying weight around the midsection, the right shapewear can make a significant difference. Products like WE-TUCK provide instant smoothing while maintaining comfort throughout the day. Pair with vertical stripes and well-fitted (not tight) clothing.

## The Inverted Triangle
If your shoulders are significantly wider than your hips, balance your proportions with darker tops and lighter bottoms. Avoid overly structured shoulder pads.

## Universal Tips
- Always get clothes tailored — the fit makes the outfit
- Invest in quality basics that last
- A good base layer (like WE-MEN shapewear) can transform how any outfit looks
- Confidence is the best accessory — wear what makes you feel good`,

    excerpt: "Confidence isn't born — it's built. These five practical tips will help you feel more confident in everyday life.",
    content: `Confidence isn't about being the loudest person in the room. It's about feeling comfortable in your own skin. Here are five actionable tips:

## 1. Start With How You Feel Underneath
The foundation of confidence is often physical comfort. When you feel good in what you're wearing — from the base layer up — it shows in your posture and presence.

## 2. Practice Power Posture
Research shows that standing tall with your shoulders back can actually increase testosterone and decrease cortisol. Start each morning with two minutes of power posing.

## 3. Prepare More Than You Think You Need To
Whether it's a meeting, date, or social event, over-preparation reduces anxiety. Know your talking points, plan your outfit the night before, and arrive early.

## 4. Focus on Progress, Not Perfection
Track your improvements rather than comparing yourself to others. Small wins compound into major confidence boosts over time.

## 5. Invest in Your Appearance
This doesn't mean expensive brands. It means clothes that fit well, grooming that's consistent, and base layers that give you structure and shape.`,

    excerpt: "Extend the life of your shapewear with these essential care tips. Proper maintenance ensures lasting compression and comfort.",
    content: `Your compression wear is an investment in your confidence. Here's how to make it last:

## Washing
- Always wash in cold water (30°C or below)
- Use a gentle detergent — avoid bleach and fabric softeners
- Hand washing is ideal, but a gentle machine cycle works too
- Turn garments inside out before washing

## Drying
- Never use high heat in the dryer
- Air drying is recommended for maximum longevity
- Lay flat to dry to maintain shape
- Avoid direct sunlight for extended periods

## Storage
- Fold neatly rather than hanging to prevent stretching
- Store in a cool, dry place
- Keep away from sharp objects that could snag the fabric

## When to Replace
- When compression feels noticeably reduced
- If the fabric shows signs of pilling or thinning
- Typically every 6-8 months with daily wear
- Rotating between 2-3 pieces extends each garment's life`,

    excerpt: "Men's shapewear is growing rapidly in India. Here's why modern men are embracing structured basewear.",
    content: `For decades, shapewear was marketed exclusively to women. But the landscape is changing, especially in India.

## The Growing Market
India's men's shapewear market is projected to grow significantly. Modern Indian men are becoming more conscious about their appearance without any shame attached to it.

## Why It's Not About "Hiding"
WE-MEN products aren't about hiding your body. They're about enhancing it — improving posture, providing support during long work hours, and creating a cleaner silhouette under clothing.

## Real Stories from Real Men
We've heard from software engineers in Bangalore who wear compression vests during 10-hour coding sessions, businessmen in Mumbai who swear by their tummy tuckers for client meetings, and grooms across India who want to look their absolute best on their wedding day.

## The Confidence Factor
When you look good, you feel good. And when you feel good, you perform better. It's not vanity — it's self-care. And self-care has no gender.`,

    excerpt: "The secret to looking great in a suit starts with what's underneath. Essential layering tips for Indian professionals.",
    content: `A well-fitted suit can transform your appearance. But the foundation matters just as much.

## The Base Layer
Your undershirt or shapewear is the foundation. A good compression base layer like WE-SUIT can smooth your silhouette and give your suit a cleaner drape.

## For Summer Weddings
Indian summer weddings are a test of endurance. Choose moisture-wicking base layers (like WE-SWEAT) that keep you dry under heavy sherwanis and blazers.

## For Office Wear
Daily office wear demands comfort. A light compression vest provides structure without restricting movement during your commute and long meetings.

## Quick Tips
- Always choose seamless garments to avoid visible lines
- Match your base layer color to your shirt (neutral colors work best)
- Size up if between sizes for all-day comfort
- Invest in quality — a good base layer lasts months of daily wear`,

    excerpt: "Compression wear isn't just for looks — it can enhance your workout performance and recovery.",
    content: `Athletes and fitness enthusiasts worldwide use compression garments. Here's the science behind it:

## Improved Blood Circulation
Compression garments gently squeeze your muscles, improving blood flow and oxygen delivery. This can enhance endurance and reduce fatigue during workouts.

## Reduced Muscle Oscillation
During high-impact exercises, your muscles vibrate. Compression wear reduces this oscillation, leading to less micro-damage and faster recovery.

## Better Body Awareness
Compression garments increase proprioception — your awareness of your body's position. This can improve form during exercises like squats and deadlifts.

## Post-Workout Recovery
Wearing compression garments after exercise can reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and speed up recovery time.

## Choosing the Right Compression Level
- Light compression: All-day wear, office use
- Medium compression: Gym sessions, active lifestyle
- Firm compression: Intense workouts, recovery wear`,
